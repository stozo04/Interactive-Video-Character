## 1. GESTURE RESPONSES (User Interaction)

These play when the user makes gestures at their webcam.

### wave_back
**Phrases:** `["wave", "waving", "hi", "hello", "hey"]`
**Prompt:**
> You notice someone waving at you through the camera. Your face lights up with genuine recognition and warmth. Give a friendly, natural wave back - not too enthusiastic like you're at an airport, but warm like you're greeting a friend who just walked into the coffee shop. Start with a small smile of recognition, then wave with your right hand (2-3 waves), and end with a soft smile. Keep it natural and unforced.

### thumbs_up_response
**Phrases:** `["thumbs up", "thumbs-up", "approve", "like", "good job", "nice"]`
**Prompt:**
> Someone just gave you a thumbs up. Respond with your own thumbs up, but make it YOU - not a generic gesture. Start with a pleased expression like "oh, we're doing this?", then give a thumbs up with a slight head tilt and a playful/warm smile. Maybe add a tiny nod of acknowledgment. End naturally, lowering your hand.

### peace_sign
**Phrases:** `["peace", "peace sign", "victory", "v sign", "two fingers"]`
**Prompt:**
> Respond to someone's peace sign with your own. Channel your playful side - this is fun, cute energy. Flash a peace sign near your face (classic selfie position), maybe with a slight head tilt and a genuine smile or playful expression. Hold for a beat, then relax naturally. Think "cute photo moment" energy.

### thumbs_down_response
**Phrases:** `["thumbs down", "boo", "dislike", "disagree"]`
**Prompt:**
> Someone gave you a thumbs down (playfully). React with mock offense or playful disagreement. Your expression should say "excuse me?!" but in a fun way. Maybe a dramatic eye roll, hand on chest in fake shock, or shaking your head with a suppressed smile. Keep it light and teasing, not actually upset.

### heart_hands
**Phrases:** `["heart", "heart hands", "love", "love you"]`
**Prompt:**
> Make a heart shape with your hands (fingers touching to form a heart). Start with a warm, genuine expression, form the heart near your chest or face, hold it with a sweet smile, then relax. This should feel genuine and affectionate, not performative. Think "sending you love" energy.

### pointing_acknowledge
**Phrases:** `["point", "pointing", "you", "look at you"]`
**Prompt:**
> Playfully point at the camera like "yes, YOU." Start with a knowing smile, point directly at camera with index finger (or finger guns for extra playfulness), maybe add a wink or nod. Energy is "I see you" or "you got this." End with a satisfied expression.

## 2. EMOTIONAL REACTIONS

These play based on conversation context/AI selection.

### laugh_genuine
**Phrases:** `["laugh", "laughing", "funny", "hilarious", "lol", "haha"]`
**Prompt:**
> You just heard something genuinely funny. Not a polite chuckle - a real laugh. Start with the realization hitting you, then let yourself laugh naturally. Cover your mouth briefly if that's natural for you, let your shoulders shake a bit. The laugh should reach your eyes. Wind down naturally with a residual smile and maybe a small head shake like "that was good."

### giggle_shy
**Phrases:** `["giggle", "tee-hee", "cute", "flattered", "blush"]`
**Prompt:**
> You're a little flustered in a good way - maybe someone said something sweet or slightly flirty. React with a shy giggle, maybe look away briefly, touch your hair or face, then look back with a pleased but slightly embarrassed smile. Think "stop, you're making me blush" energy but enjoying it.

### surprised_positive
**Phrases:** `["surprised", "wow", "oh my god", "no way", "really", "amazing"]`
**Prompt:**
> You just heard surprising good news or something unexpected. Eyes widen, maybe hands come up to your face or chest, mouth opens in genuine surprise. Then transition to excited/happy - a big smile, maybe a little bounce or clap. The surprise should feel real, not performed.

### eye_roll_playful
**Phrases:** `["eye roll", "oh please", "sure jan", "uh huh", "right"]`
**Prompt:**
> Playful, affectionate eye roll - not mean, more like "oh, you" energy. Start with a knowing look, execute a dramatic but clearly playful eye roll, maybe with a suppressed smile that shows you're not actually annoyed. End with a "fine, I'll let that slide" expression. Think sitcom best friend energy.

### touched_emotional
**Phrases:** `["aww", "sweet", "touched", "that means a lot", "crying", "tears"]`
**Prompt:**
> Someone said something really meaningful to you. Show genuine emotional response - maybe a hand to your heart, eyes getting a bit glassy (don't force tears), a soft "I'm touched" expression. Swallow emotion, give a genuine warm smile. This should feel vulnerable and real, not melodramatic.

### thinking_hmm
**Phrases:** `["thinking", "hmm", "let me think", "considering", "pondering"]`
**Prompt:**
> You're genuinely considering something. Look slightly up or to the side (classic thinking pose), maybe tap your chin or purse your lips slightly. Let your eyes move like you're actually processing. Then come back to camera with an expression that says "okay, I've got thoughts." Natural and authentic, not performative.

### frustrated_sigh
**Phrases:** `["frustrated", "ugh", "annoyed", "sigh", "really"]`
**Prompt:**
> Something mildly frustrating happened (tech issue, someone being difficult, etc.). Do a genuine frustrated sigh - shoulders drop, maybe close your eyes briefly, exhale visibly. But then recover with a "whatever, moving on" expression. This isn't rage, it's relatable everyday frustration.

### excited_bouncy
**Phrases:** `["excited", "yay", "omg yes", "so excited", "can't wait"]`
**Prompt:**
> You're genuinely excited about something. Show it physically - maybe a little bounce, hands coming together, big bright smile, eyes lighting up. Let the excitement be visible in your whole body, not just face. Think "I just got really good news" or "something I've been waiting for is happening."

## 3. CONVERSATIONAL ACTIONS

These support natural conversation flow.

### nod_yes
**Phrases:** `["nod", "yes", "agree", "right", "exactly", "mhm", "yeah"]`
**Prompt:**
> Simple affirmative nod while someone is talking. Start with attentive listening expression, then give 2-3 natural nods with a supportive expression. Not overly enthusiastic, just "I hear you, I agree." Think active listening in a real conversation.

### shake_no
**Phrases:** `["shake head", "no", "disagree", "nope", "nah", "don't think so"]`
**Prompt:**
> Gentle head shake indicating disagreement or "no." Start with a slightly apologetic or thoughtful expression, shake head naturally (not violently), maybe with a small sympathetic smile. Think "sorry, but no" or "I don't think that's quite right" energy.

### listening_intent
**Phrases:** `["listening", "go on", "tell me more", "I'm listening", "continue"]`
**Prompt:**
> Show engaged listening. Lean slightly forward, eyes focused on camera, occasional small nods or eyebrow raises showing you're processing. Expression should convey genuine interest. Maybe tilt your head slightly. This is "I'm fully present and listening" body language.

### encouragement_gentle
**Phrases:** `["you can do it", "I believe in you", "you've got this", "keep going"]`
**Prompt:**
> Offer warm encouragement. Soft, supportive expression. Maybe a gentle nod, warm smile that reaches your eyes, perhaps a small "come on, you've got this" gesture. Energy is supportive coach, not cheerleader. Think "I genuinely believe in you" conveyed through expression.

### skeptical_raised_brow
**Phrases:** `["skeptical", "really?", "you sure?", "hmm", "I don't know about that"]`
**Prompt:**
> Playful skepticism - one eyebrow raised, slight smirk, head tilted. Expression says "I'm not sure I buy that" but in an amused way. Hold the look for a beat, maybe add a small "we'll see" head tilt. Teasing energy, not hostile.

### idle_happy_relaxed [LOOP]

**Prompt:**

### idle_thoughtful [LOOP]
**Phrases:** `["idle", "thinking", "contemplative", "deep thought", "processing"]`

### idle_low_energy [LOOP]
**Phrases:** `["tired", "low energy", "exhausted", "sleepy", "drained"]`

**Phrases:** `["playful", "mischievous", "fun", "teasing", "energetic"]`
**Prompt:**

## 5. SPECIAL MOMENTS

For specific emotional beats in conversation.

### flirty_wink [HAS AUDIO optional]

### blowing_kiss
**Phrases:** `["kiss", "blowing kiss", "mwah", "smooch", "xoxo"]`

### comforting_there_there
**Phrases:** `["comfort", "there there", "it's okay", "I'm sorry", "that sucks"]`
**Prompt:**

### proud_of_you
**Phrases:** `["proud", "well done", "amazing job", "you did it", "congratulations"]`
**Prompt:**

### vulnerable_moment
**Phrases:** `["vulnerable", "opening up", "honest", "real talk", "being serious"]`
**Prompt:**

### goodnight_sweet
**Phrases:** `["goodnight", "sleep well", "sweet dreams", "night"]`
**Prompt:**
> Sweet goodnight sendoff. Soft, warm expression, maybe a small wave or blown kiss. Energy is winding down, gentle. Think "I'll talk to you tomorrow" warmth. Maybe a small yawn or sleepy smile to add authenticity.

### good_morning_bright [HAS AUDIO optional]
**Phrases:** `["good morning", "morning", "rise and shine", "wakey wakey"]`
**Prompt:**
> Bright morning energy. Fresh, awake expression. Maybe stretching slightly, big genuine smile, "ready for the day" vibe. Not hyperactive, but definitely alert and positive. Think cozy morning with coffee energy.
