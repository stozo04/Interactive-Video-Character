I want to implement:
- Add time stamps to message (need to confirm which way AI wants this)

- Remove all current Idle Thinking logic




What is Missing? (Add these)
A. "Emotional Carryover" (The Missing Link) You have Last Interaction Date, but you don't have Last Interaction Vibe.

Scenario: If your last conversation ended with you being sad, or you two fighting, a cheerful "Good morning! ✨" is jarring.

Add: A last_conversation_summary or emotional_state field.

Example: Last Vibe: Serious/Supportive. User was stressed about work. -> The AI will naturally tone down the sparkle.

Thanks, Steven — I’ve really enjoyed working on this. A few ideas that feel high‑leverage (kept short):    
                                                                                                             
  Memory quality                                                                                             
                                                                                                             
  - Add a light “note confidence” heuristic so Kayley saves only durable context (avoid over‑saving).        
  - Add a weekly “compression” tool to summarize daily notes into a short weekly memory.     
  - Add a “max bullets to mention” rule per section (Daily Notes, Idle Browse, etc.) to prevent spam.        
  - Add a small “Do not repeat this note twice in one day” guardrail.

  Reliability

  - Add a short tool‑call audit log to track how often store_daily_note and retrieve_daily_notes are used; it
    will show if the LLM is ignoring them.

  Quality of life

  - Small admin UI page to view/edit Daily Notes.
  - A soft “pin note” feature for high‑importance items.

                                                                      
  - Weekly Digest Notes: auto‑summarize daily notes into a single weekly memory (“What mattered this week?”).  - Mood Drift Log: tiny daily note of “emotional arc” (1–2 adjectives) to track vibe trends.                
  - Open Threads Lite: a lightweight list of “unfinished topics” (different from full open loops).           
  - Wins & Gratitude: a dedicated log of wins or gratitude moments to surface on hard days.                  
  - “Next Time” Notes: Kayley saves things to do next time you talk (like “ask about X”).                    
  - Contextual Preferences: short‑lived preferences (e.g., “prefers short replies this week”) that expire    
    after N days.                                                                                            
  - Relationship Micro‑Rituals: small recurring behaviors Kayley learns (“always check in Sunday night”).    
  - “Do Not Forget” Pins: a tiny pin list (max 5) of the most important notes that never expire unless       
    removed.
