I want to implement:
- Add time stamps to message (need to confirm which way AI wants this)
- Set up Idle Thinking for Questions to ask
   - When I go idle that is when most people:
      (maybe a 33% chance of:)
      - Start working on life_storyline
      - Searching/Browsing the web b/c of boredom
      - Think of questions they want to ask
         - Create a list of all known facts about the user and
         send that to LLM along with Kayley information
         LLM can decide what it wants to learn and then add to list of questions to ask
         - When user returns in the NonGreetingPrompt append list of questions
         but do not dump the questions all at once. Make these questions come up naturally
         there is no "rush" or "urgency" a deep relationship takes time to build
     - Cooldown:
       How does a cooldown work? If there is a 33% chance of the following and 
       idle kicks off lets say 5 minutes of inactivity this can generate a lot
       of browsing requests / life_storyline / tons of questions. so we need 
       some way of saying ok this has been called x amount today.. skipping
      
- Remove all current Idle Thinking logic
- Add Video creation
- Confirm with LLM to see if I need to always pass in Calendar and Tasks else figure a way to only send on change
- Remove unused env variables
What is Missing? (Add these)
A. "Emotional Carryover" (The Missing Link) You have Last Interaction Date, but you don't have Last Interaction Vibe.

Scenario: If your last conversation ended with you being sad, or you two fighting, a cheerful "Good morning! ✨" is jarring.

Add: A last_conversation_summary or emotional_state field.

Example: Last Vibe: Serious/Supportive. User was stressed about work. -> The AI will naturally tone down the sparkle.
