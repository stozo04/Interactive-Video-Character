I want to implement:
- Add time stamps to message (need to confirm which way AI wants this)
- Set up Idle Thinking for Questions to ask
   - When I go idle that is when most people:
      (maybe a 33% chance of:)
      - Start working on life_storyline
      - Searching/Browsing the web b/c of boredom
      - Think of questions they want to ask
         - Create a list of all known facts about the user and
         send that to LLM along with Kayley information
         LLM can decide what it wants to learn and then add to list of questions to ask
         - When user returns in the NonGreetingPrompt append list of questions
         but do not dump the questions all at once. Make these questions come up naturally
         there is no "rush" or "urgency" a deep relationship takes time to build
     - Cooldown:
       How does a cooldown work? If there is a 33% chance of the following and 
       idle kicks off lets say 5 minutes of inactivity this can generate a lot
       of browsing requests / life_storyline / tons of questions. so we need 
       some way of saying ok this has been called x amount today.. skipping       
      
- Remove all current Idle Thinking logic




What is Missing? (Add these)
A. "Emotional Carryover" (The Missing Link) You have Last Interaction Date, but you don't have Last Interaction Vibe.

Scenario: If your last conversation ended with you being sad, or you two fighting, a cheerful "Good morning! ✨" is jarring.

Add: A last_conversation_summary or emotional_state field.

Example: Last Vibe: Serious/Supportive. User was stressed about work. -> The AI will naturally tone down the sparkle.

Thanks, Steven — I’ve really enjoyed working on this. A few ideas that feel high‑leverage (kept short):    
                                                                                                             
  Memory quality                                                                                             
                                                                                                             
  - Add a light “note confidence” heuristic so Kayley saves only durable context (avoid over‑saving).        
  - Add a weekly “compression” tool to summarize daily notes into a short weekly memory.                     

  - Add a “max bullets to mention” rule per section (Daily Notes, Idle Browse, etc.) to prevent spam.        
  - Add a small “Do not repeat this note twice in one day” guardrail.

  Reliability

  - Add a short tool‑call audit log to track how often store_daily_note and retrieve_daily_notes are used; it
    will show if the LLM is ignoring them.

  Quality of life

  - Small admin UI page to view/edit Daily Notes.
  - A soft “pin note” feature for high‑importance items.

  If any of those sound interesting, I can outline a plan.
                                                                                                             
                                                                                                             
› what about additional features that are similiar to this that i have not thought about                     
                                                                                                             
                                                                                                             
• I need to provide a concise brainstorming list without web access and ask the user for their preference on 
  how to proceed.                                                                                            

• Here are some “adjacent” ideas to Daily Notes that keep the same spirit (LLM‑chosen, lightweight,
  append‑only), but add new value:                                                                           
                                                                                                             
  - Weekly Digest Notes: auto‑summarize daily notes into a single weekly memory (“What mattered this week?”).  - Mood Drift Log: tiny daily note of “emotional arc” (1–2 adjectives) to track vibe trends.                
  - Open Threads Lite: a lightweight list of “unfinished topics” (different from full open loops).           
  - Wins & Gratitude: a dedicated log of wins or gratitude moments to surface on hard days.                  
  - “Next Time” Notes: Kayley saves things to do next time you talk (like “ask about X”).                    
  - Contextual Preferences: short‑lived preferences (e.g., “prefers short replies this week”) that expire    
    after N days.                                                                                            
  - Relationship Micro‑Rituals: small recurring behaviors Kayley learns (“always check in Sunday night”).    
  - “Do Not Forget” Pins: a tiny pin list (max 5) of the most important notes that never expire unless       
    removed.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                             
  If you like any of these, tell me which ones and I’ll sketch how to fit them into the existing tool +      
  prompt architecture.
